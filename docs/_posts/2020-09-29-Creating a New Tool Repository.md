1) visit github.com/nanoMFG and accept invitation<br>
2) Hit the "new" button :<br>
3) Select repo options and create repo.
   - Try to use a relatively short name with no spaces.<br>
   - Add a description<br>
   - Select a template such as "toolstart-jupyter" for a new jupyter notebook tool. <br>
Make the repo public if you intent to release via open source or private if you want to keep hidden until release.<br>
